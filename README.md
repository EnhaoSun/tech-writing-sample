**TaskFlow API Documentation**

---

**Introduction**
Welcome to the TaskFlow API documentation. TaskFlow offers a collaborative task management platform, enabling teams to streamline their work. With our RESTful APIs, you can integrate TaskFlow capabilities into your tools, applications, and services.

**Getting Started**
Before you start making API calls, you need to:

1. Create a TaskFlow account.
2. Obtain your API Key from the 'Developer' section.

**API Base URL**
All API requests should be made to: `https://api.taskflow.com/`

---

**1. Create Task**
- **URL**: `/tasks`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Authorization**: Bearer Token (Your API Key)
- **Payload**:
  ```json
  {
      "title": "Task title",
      "description": "Task description",
      "due_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "assignee": "user_email@example.com"
  }
  ```
- **Success Response**:
  ```json
  {
      "message": "Task created successfully",
      "task_id": "abcdef123456"
  }
  ```

---

**2. Get Task Details**
- **URL**: `/tasks/:taskId`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Authorization**: Bearer Token (Your API Key)
- **Success Response**:
  ```json
  {
      "task_id": "abcdef123456",
      "title": "Task title",
      "description": "Task description",
      "status": "Open",
      "due_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "assignee": "user_email@example.com",
      "comments": []
  }
  ```

**Features and Enhancements**

1. **Collaborative Comments**: Add comments to tasks and enable team discussions right within each task. You can also use the `/tasks/:taskId/comments` endpoint to automate comment additions.
2. **Task Labels**: Categorize tasks with labels for better organization. Use the `/labels` endpoint to create and manage labels programmatically.
3. **Due Date Notifications**: Automated reminders ensure no tasks are overlooked. This feature is automatic for all tasks with a due date.
4. **File Attachments**: Attach documents, images, and other files to tasks. Use the `/tasks/:taskId/attachments` endpoint to manage task attachments via API.

**Code Sample: Python - Creating a New Task**

```python
import requests

API_URL = "https://api.taskflow.com/tasks"
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

data = {
    "title": "Meeting notes",
    "description": "Compile and distribute meeting notes",
    "due_date": "2023-09-15",
    "assignee": "john.doe@example.com"
}

response = requests.post(API_URL, headers=headers, json=data)
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Task created successfully!")
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.text}")
```
